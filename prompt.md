I want you to output Rust code. The program renders with SDL2 library. It should display voxels grid. The grid is filled with voxels such way that they forms a sphere. The camera looks at the scene at angle. The camera rotates around the sphere. There is one directional light coming from an angle. Don't explain anything. Don't omit any code.
